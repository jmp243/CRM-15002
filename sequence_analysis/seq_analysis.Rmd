# fit data to TraMiner
# first duration is not important
# unequal sequence lengths
# normalize sequence lengths by changing the alphabets
we are only using data that currently exists. 

optimal matching it was developed for genomics. 
clustering sequence. 

state plots vs sequence plots
Events don't have duration. Events have dates.

number of sequences is 5000 to 10000 limit. 
sequence length is 100-300. 
alphabet size is 12-20 colors. 
missing data, delete incomplete sequences. 

```{r}
length(unique(peak_fall2021[["new_ID"]])) #13301
```
students with multiple sequences. 24,952 total and 11,651 has multiple
```{r}
multi_students <- peak_fall2021 %>% 
  filter(seqnum>1) # this is only 11651
```
There are 5693 unique sequences in Mode and Dept for peak fall 2021. 
So like 2 people share the same sequence.


This is still larger than the TraMiner Sequence limit

Frequency table
```{r}
df_freq_table = attr(seqtab(df_seq, idxs = 0, format='STS'), "freq")
length(which(df_freq_table$Freq==1)) #1663

```
all 6 used 
```{r}
df_seq_len = seqlength(df_seq)
sum(df_seq_len==6)

the alphabet
```{r}
alphabet(df_seq)
```

transitions probabilities
```{r}
trans = seqtrate(df_seq)
round(trans,2)
```

state frequencies
```{r}
seqstatd(df_seq)

```{r}
seqHtplot(df_seq)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
