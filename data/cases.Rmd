## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### for CRM-15002
    1.break out service desk cases that are initiated by students vs other
    2. use the resulting student data to examine if and how students create cases in SD 
        a. by dept
        b. across dept

Here we are seeking to answer the following questions:
    - what mode do students go to first when they want to solve a problem? (overall and by dept)
    - do students tend to avail themselves of multiple avenues of service desk for the same problem? If so, how? does it vary by dept? 

SF objects to be used:
    cases
    student enrollments
    <!-- chattranscript -->
    
```{r}
table(cases_did$RecordTypeId)
```
```{r}

```

# evaluate some merged data
```{r}
table(left_enroll$DeveloperName, left_enroll$class_standing)
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Tricky thing to summarize if 

x = time, y = origin, do scatterplots, lines linking data points to users. shift alpha low. 
do it as first pass. 

What types of transitions are happening? 

Plot contacts by divisions. 

# figure out average length of time from one case to the next case per user
```{r}
library(dplyr)                                        
origin_cases %>% distinct(new_ID, .keep_all = TRUE)
origin_cases %>% group_by(new_ID) %>% filter(row_number() == 1)
origin_cases %>% group_by(new_ID) %>% slice(1)
```
 or you can just see this 
```{r}
length(unique(origin_cases[["AZ_time4"]])) #143866
length(unique(origin_cases[["new_ID"]])) #47506
length(unique(origin_cases[["Id"]])) #145212
```
 # look at the everything data sample
```{r}
length(unique(everything[["new_ID"]]))
```
 # This may not be so important though.
 ## for every new_ID calculate the time intervals from one case to the next 
 ## if the new_ID only has one case then skip this. 
 ## store the average lead/lag per new_ID in a new column

 remove duplicates in origin cases
```{r}
origin_case2 <- origin_cases %>%
  arrange(new_ID, -CaseNumber) %>%
  filter(duplicated(CaseNumber) == FALSE) #down to 145,212
```
 
```{r}
origin_cases %>% group_by(new_ID) %>% 
  summarise(COUNT = n()) 
# %>% 
#   summarise(mean= mean(COUNT)) # mean = 4.05
```
subset data to multiple row only

lag and lead
https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/lead-lag.html
```{r}
multi_cases <- origin_cases %>% group_by(new_ID) %>% 
  mutate(COUNT = n())

multi_cases <- multi_cases %>% 
  filter(COUNT >= 2)
```
looking at the unique length
remove duplicates
```{r}

```

```{r}
length(unique(multi_cases[["new_ID"]])) #31039
```

```{r}

```
summary with removed duplicates
```{r}
origin_case2 <- origin_cases %>%
   arrange(new_ID, -CaseNumber) %>%
   filter(duplicated(CaseNumber) == FALSE) #down to 128,745

origin_case2 <- origin_case2 %>% group_by(new_ID) %>% 
  mutate(COUNT = n())

summary(origin_case2$COUNT)
```

new length
```{r}
length(unique(origin_case2[["new_ID"]])) 
```
```{r}
origin_case3 <- subset(origin_case2, select = c(new_ID, Students, Department__c, Cumulative_GPA__c, 
                                                period, Origin, COUNT, Created_Day_of_Week__c,
                                                AZ_date4, AZ_time, CaseNumber))

origin_case3 %>% 
  group_by(new_ID) %>% 
  summarise(order_count = max(COUNT)) %>% 
  ungroup()

```
```{r}
origin_case3 %>% 
  group_by(new_ID) %>% 
  arrange(AZ_time) %>%
    # select(c(new_ID, AZ_time, CaseNumber, Department__c, Origin, COUNT)) %>%
  mutate(seqnum = 1:length(new_ID))
```
try getting a new column that has time since last interaction
look at the data 
```{r}
origin_case3 %>% 
  select(c(new_ID, AZ_time, CaseNumber, COUNT, seqnum)) %>%
  arrange(new_ID)

```
Also, create a new column that stores time since last interaction for new_ID's that have seqnum that is greater than 1.
```{r}
origin_case3 <- origin_case2 %>% 
   mutate(AZ_date4 = as.Date(AZ_time4)) %>% 
   mutate(AZ_time = as.POSIXlt(AZ_time4, tz = "",
                               tryFormats = c("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS"), 
                               optional = FALSE))


# origin_case4 <- origin_case3 %>%
#       group_by(RUN = data.table::rleid(new_ID)) %>%
#       # group_by(new_ID) %>%
#       summarize(START = min(AZ_time),
#                 END = max(AZ_time),
#                 MAX = max(seqnum)) %>% 
#       mutate(DURATION_HRS = as.numeric((END - START)/60)) #what did I do here?

origin_case3 %>% 
  select(c(new_ID,seqnum, AZ_time)) %>% 
  group_by(new_ID) %>% 
  arrange(desc(seqnum)) %>% 
  # mutate(time_since = time at seqnum == 2 minus time at seqnum == 1 )
  
```

Code with David's help using dplyr
```{r}
origin_case2 <- origin_case2 %>% 
  group_by(new_ID) %>% 
  arrange(seqnum) %>% 
  # mutate(n = n()) %>% # essentially count
  mutate(tmp = lag(AZ_time),
         diff = AZ_time - tmp)

```
How do I analyze lag time? 
```{r}

```


prune the department names
```{r}
table(origin_case2$Department__c)

sort1.Dept <- origin_case2[order(Department__c), ]
```


plot a sample
```{r}
out_plot3 <- origin_case2 %>% 
  # pivot_longer(index) %>% 
  filter(seqnum > 70) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=AZ_time4, y=Origin, group=new_ID)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=new_ID)) + 
  geom_line(aes(colour=new_ID)) +
  geom_dl(aes(label=new_ID), method="last.points") # or "first.points"

# out_plot3 <- out_plot3 + geom_label_repel(aes(label = new_ID),
#                                             box.padding   = 0.35, 
#                                             point.padding = 0.5,
#                                             segment.color = 'grey50') 
print(out_plot3)

```

change origins into 6 modes
```{r}
table(origin_case3$Mode)
```

First modes used 
```{r}
first_mode <- student_data2 %>% 
  filter(seqnum == 1)

table(first_mode$Mode, first_mode$Department__c)
```
table with first dept
```{r}
table(first_mode$Dept)
```

Create two 6 by 6 transition matrices. 

 Try https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hesim/vignettes/mstate.html
```{r}
tibble(origin_case5)
```
 so how many students create more than one case? 
```{r}
summary(student_data2$seqnum)
```
 
# How likely are users changing from one mode to a different mode?
```{r}
Mode_graph <- origin_case2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(Mode, names_to = "question", values_to = "response", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = response, fill = Students)) +
  geom_bar() +
  # geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..)) +
  labs(x = "Mode", y = "Count") 

Mode_graph <- Mode_graph + labs(title = "Cases per Mode",
                              # subtitle = "", 
                              fill = "Status") +
                              scale_fill_discrete(
                              # breaks=c("Graduate", "Undergraduate", "NA"),
                              labels=c("Graduate", "Undergraduate", "Not Students"))

print(Mode_graph)

```

Get information on number of sequences. It could be from the seqnum
```{r}
student_data2 %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(seqnum)) 
```
mean time for non -first cases
```{r}
student_data2 %>% 
  group_by(Mode) %>% 
  filter(seqnum >=2) %>% 
  summarize(mean_time = mean(tm1.dechr))

student_data2 %>% 
  filter(seqnum >= 2) %>% 
  # summarize(mean_time = mean(tm1.dechr))
  summarize(count = n())
```

first modes of comm
```{r}
first_mode %>% 
  group_by(Mode) %>% 
  summarize(mean_time = mean(tm1.dechr))
```
overview of percentages for modes used
```{r}
overview_pct <- first_mode %>%
  group_by(Dept) %>%
  drop_na(Dept) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(pct = count/sum(count))

overview_pct1 <- student_data2 %>%
  group_by(Dept) %>%
  drop_na(Dept) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%  
  mutate(pct = count/sum(count))

overview_pct2 <- student_data2 %>%
  group_by(Mode) %>%
  drop_na(Mode) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%  #count records by species
  mutate(pct = count/sum(count))
```

print the geom tile
```{r}
Mode_tile <-
  ggplot(data=subset(origin_case4, !is.na(Mode)), aes(y = Mode, x = next_mode)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill=prob), color = "white") +
  # scale_fill_manual(values=colors) +
  labs(title = "Likelihood of Moving to the Another Mode",
       x = "Next Mode", y = "Starting Mode") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#86ebc9",
                      high = "#09855c",
                      guide = "colorbar") 
  # theme_minimal()

Mode_tile
```
# How likely are users changing from one department to a different department?

```{r}
Dept_tile <-
  ggplot(data=subset(origin_case5, !is.na(Dept)), aes(y = Dept, x = ord.x)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill=prob), color = "white") +
  # scale_fill_manual(values=colors) +
  labs(title = "Likelihood of Moving to the Another Department",
       x = "Next Department", y = "Starting Department") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#86ebc9",
                      high = "#09855c",
                      guide = "colorbar") 
# theme_minimal()

Dept_tile

```
##TraMiner 
data in SPELL form if starting with TMP and end with AZtime (in POSIXlt)
SPELL format would be new_ID, seqnum, AZ_time, tmp, Mode or Dept.
