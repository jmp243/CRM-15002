## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### for CRM-15002
    1.break out service desk cases that are initiated by students vs other
    2. use the resulting student data to examine if and how students create cases in SD 
        a. by dept
        b. across dept

Here we are seeking to answer the following questions:
    - what mode do students go to first when they want to solve a problem? (overall and by dept)
    - do students tend to avail themselves of multiple avenues of service desk for the same problem? If so, how? does it vary by dept? 

SF objects to be used:
    cases
    student enrollments
    <!-- chattranscript -->
    
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
# evaluate some merged data
```{r}
table(left_enroll$DeveloperName, left_enroll$class_standing)
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
